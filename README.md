# Baldwin

**What is Baldwin?**
- Baldwin is an attempt to make a machine learning library with the 
functional programming language *Haskell*.

**Why?**
- The reason for undertaking a project like this is two-fold:
    - To understand what *machine learning* really even means.
    - To learn about the *functional programming* paradigm.

**Method?**
- I am interested in starting at a fairly fundamental level, by which I mean
linear algebra, calculus, and the like.
- There are no doubt libraries already available for one to begin implementing
algorithms right away, but I imagine it would be much more rewarding to build
this from the ground up.
